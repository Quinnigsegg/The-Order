The order works as follow, The monks of the Avowed have a branch called "The order of the sun", this branch have 2 branches, the Librarians called "the seekers of knowledge", and the military called "The Legion".

The seekers of knwoledge:

  They consiste of the bulk of the order members, they are prominent in places of knowledge all across the land besides some places (like neverwinter since i was there), they seek knowledge and trade on it, but 
what the seek the most is ancient and forgotten knowledge of the past ages that they record, store and keep hidden from the people, only they and the people they choose are to get the knowledge, some of that 
knowledge could be medicine to deadly diseases, dark and forbidden magic, secrets of the realm and hidden stories that were kept from the people to not cause either panic or a revolt, etc... they feed people
what ever knowledge they are willing to share but not all of it. they consiste of scholars and excavation masters, but they are not defencless, they are trained in the dark art and forbidden  magic. they are 
the brain of the Order.

The Legion:

  Carefully handpicked Men set to carry out the orders missions, they speak of few words if none at all, they are highly skilled and highly trained millitary personnel that have the best gear and information
to carry out the missions with no failure, if they are set to carry a mission, they plan everything to make the mission a success (it's by studying them that i learned how to do the same), they are fierce 
opponents and cleaver tactitians, they eleminate the treats and show no mercy, mission is prime to them and they would go to any leght to get it done, even at the expence of lives including their own,
they consist of mainly paladins, clerics and fighters, that weild swords, shields, maces, warhammers, and heavy armor, they would sometimes recure into recruting ruffians to distract or eliminate the treat
while they carry out their missions. they are stations all across the lands, and they have very good memory of it, they have hideouts and holding places where they question the captives for crutial information
about their mission. they also act as the defenders of the Order in case the order is either questionned or treatened (for example if someone is to expose the orther, he vanishes). they receive their missions
and instructions via written encripted messages only a member of the order or the legion can decifer.
